## Most Used & Standard Best Practice Patterns
This repository includes implementations and examples of the most widely used and recommended patterns in Dart and software engineering:

1. **Singleton** – Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access.
2. **Factory** – Create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
3. **Observer** – Define a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
4. **Strategy** – Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
5. **Decorator** – Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
6. **Command** – Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests.
7. **Adapter** – Allow the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

You’ll find code samples and explanations for these patterns in the `patterns/` folder.
